  \begin{block}{Introduction}
  In this study, we developed a watershed delineation model for the hexagon grid spatial discretization. We applied this model to different types of watershed in the US. Then we evaluated its performance against the traditional method. The comparisons show that results from hexagon grid spatial discretization exhibit many advantages over the tradition method. We suggest spatially distributed hydrological simulation should consider hexagon grid spatial discretization.

  \begin{block}{Limitation}
    First, the HexWatershed model relies on the performance of DEM resampling method. Advanced resampling methods are desired in order to convert existing dataset including DEM into the HGSD framework \cite{Her1994}.
    Second, this model only considers the steepest slope as the single flow direction. In some scenarios, multiple flow directions should be considered  \cite{Henson2013}.
    Third, we haven't implemented the capability of burn-in existing stream networks into the DEM, which could further improve the performance \cite{Hellweger1997}.
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{block}{Conclusion}
    Because of the consistent connectivity, nearly all spatial distributions of watershed characteristics (e.g., flow direction and stream networks) are closer to the reality at various resolutions.
  
    Our analysis implies that spatially distributed hydrological simulations which rely on connectivity/routing will be improved if we use the hexagon grid spatial discretization method \cite{Hamilton2014}.
  
    Our model can be applied to continent or global scale to improve the large scale hydrological simulations, especially for high latitude hydrological simulations.
